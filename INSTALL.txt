Setting up Solr
---------------

In order for this module to work, you will first need to set up a Solr server.
See search_api_solr/INSTALL.txt for the basics.

But search_api_solr_multilingual adds some more restrictions and requires a
different kind of configuration.

search_api_solr_multilingual requires at least solr 5.4.x.

The files in search_api_solr_multilingual/solr-conf/ from this module are
different from the ones that are part of search_api_solr/solr-conf/!


Configuring Drupal
------------------

search_api_solr_multilingual provides it's own backend for search_api. It derives and
extends the one provides by search_api_solr.

NOTE: It's important that the solr server rund with the right config files for
a backend. Don't switch between the Solr Backend and the Solr Multilingual
Backend without adjusting the config files!
