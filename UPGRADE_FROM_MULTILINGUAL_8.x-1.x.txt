ensure that all your composer managed stuff is up to date, for example run
"composer install" or "composer update" depending on your setup and update your
drupal installation:
  drush updb

export all Search API server configs that use a multilingual solr backend
export all Search API index configs that use such a server

Uninstall the module from drupal
(ignore these Exceptions, see https://www.drupal.org/node/2909645):
  drush pm-uninstall search_api_solr_multilingual

Remove the module from your composer setup:
  composer remove drupal/search_api_solr_multilingual

Upgrade to Search API Solr 8.x-2.x (adjust the version to your needs, for
example ~2.0-dev):
  composer require drupal/search_api_solr ~2.0

re-import all Search API server configs that use a multilingual solr backend
re-import all Search API index configs that use such a server

run all search_api_solr update hooks:
  drush updb

re-install the latest solr field type configs:
  drush sasm-reinstall-ft

generate up-to-date configs for all servers and deploy them to your solr
servers:
  drush sasm-gsc ...
